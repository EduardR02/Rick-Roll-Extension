# Rick-Roll-Extension
Extension that continuously swaps all images and videos with Never Gonna Give You Up  
Works most of the time :)

## Use guide
The videos and images / gifs that are swapped into the web pages / videoplayers are located in the  
folders with the same name. You can put any video/image/gif you desire in there, they are randomly chosen for  
each substitution. Then update the filenames in content.js to match the files you added.  
Tip: You can substitue images for gifs to make it less boring.
